OpenPhotoBooth is a project to create an open source application suite for creating cheap and easy photo booths, such as those you would find in a mall.

We want to avoid putting limitations on OpenPhotoBooth, so you don't have to get a computer just for it, or buy expensive hardware to use it. You can just run it on your regular home computer or laptop using a consumer grade webcam.

OpenPhotoBooth is licensed under the MIT License  and we encourage you to use it commercially. It's not feasible for everyone to make their own booth, so feel free to rent or lend your creation out once you've made it.
